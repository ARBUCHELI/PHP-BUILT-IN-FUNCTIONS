# INTRO TO BUILT-IN PHP FUNCTIONS
---------------------------------

* Working with Variables
------------------------
	PHP includes useful built-in functions for getting information about variables. The gettype() function takes a variable as its argument and returns a string value representing the 
	data type of the argument.

		$name = "Aisle Nevertell";
		$age = 1000000;
 
		echo gettype($name); // Prints: string
 
		echo gettype($age); // Prints: integer

	Notice that we didn’t write a definition for the gettype() function ourselves—it’s built into PHP. Since the function is included within the language itself, we can just call it 
	anywhere within our PHP code.

	Let’s take a look at another built-in function! The var_dump() function also takes a variable argument. It prints details about the argument it receives.

		var_dump($name); // Prints: string(15) "Aisle Nevertell"
 
		var_dump($age); // Prints: int(1000000)

	In the code above, we first used var_dump() to print information about the variable $name. string(15)—the variable’s type and length—were printed followed by the value held by the 
	variable.

	Next, we used var_dump() to print information about the variable $age. Here, the integer is printed within the parentheses.

	As we learn more data types—especially increasingly complex data types—we’ll see how useful these two functions can be. For now, let’s practice using them with the types of data 
	we know!
